# Access Network Topology Inferring Methods

## Project Overview
	
- This repo is about the code for [Infering Regional Access Network Topologies: Methods and Applications](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3487552.3487812). The paper has been accepted to Internet Measurement Conference (IMC) 2021. It includes source code for McTraceroute and ShipTraceroute and some tiny tools that you might find helpful for your measurement research.

## Documentation
